# New in 2.7.3
- Generic way of introducing potentials added.
- Generic Trace operators of those potentials introduced.
- Composed user defined operators can be constructed.
More information can be found in the documentation.
Corrected bugs:
- Minus sign in the normalvector cross RT and ND space.
- Construction of the duallagrangec0d1 space.
- Quadstrat in the LinearCombinationOfOperators.

# New in 2.7.2

- GMRES from Krylov.jl wrapped as a LinearMap
- Function `union` for a vector of spaces of the same type and defined on the same mesh returns a space containing the union of the functions in the input spaces.
- Function `extend` computes the extension by zero of functions defined on a submesh. Currently works only when the corresponding cellls in the submesh and supermesh are ordered identically (oriented identically is not sufficient).

## New in 2.7.0

- PR #157: Improved support for 2D Helmholtz problems
